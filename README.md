# exercism-python
My answers for the exercism.io python track. You can find my profile over here [exercism.io/cglacet](https://exercism.io/profiles/cglacet)

Exercises from the main track are:
 - [leap](leap) ([_.py solution_](leap/leap.py))
 - [Bob](bob) ([_.py solution_](bob/bob.py))
 - [allergies](allergies) ([_.py solution_](allergies/allergies.py))
 - [sum-of-multiples](sum-of-multiples) ([_.py solution_](sum-of-multiples/sum-of-multiples.py))
 - [kindergarten-garden](kindergarten-garden) ([_.py solution_](kindergarten-garden/kindergarten-garden.py))
 - [grade-school](grade-school) ([_.py solution_](grade-school/grade-school.py))
 - [saddle-points](saddle-points) (in progress)

Extra exercises that I think are interesting:
 - Error raising: [bank-account](bank-account)
 - Stack size issues: [flatten-array](flatten-array)
 - Not so easy algorithmical problem: [rectangles](rectangles) (if you find/found a simpler solution I'm interesed)
